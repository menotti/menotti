# Prof. Ricardo **Menotti**

I hold a B.Sc. in Computer Science from Universidade do Oeste Paulista (2002), an M.Sc. in Computer Science and Computational Mathematics from the University of SÃ£o Paulo (2005), and a Ph.D. in the same field from the University of SÃ£o Paulo (2010). I am currently an Associate Professor in the [Department of Computing](https://dc.ufscar.br) at the [Federal University of SÃ£o Carlos](https://ufscar.br). My research focuses on Computer Architecture, High-Performance Computing, Heterogeneous Computing, Embedded Systems, and Compilers. In particular, I investigate techniques for accelerating applications through heterogeneous architectures that integrate FPGAs, GPUs, and other specialized platforms, targeting both large-scale scientific workloads and resource-constrained embedded systems.
